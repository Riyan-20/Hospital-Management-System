# Hospital Patient Record Management System

This C++ program implements a patient record management system for hospitals using a binary search tree (BST). It allows users to efficiently insert, edit, search, and remove patient records. Additionally, it demonstrates tree splitting functionality and counting the number of nodes in a subtree.

## Features

- **Insertion**: Add new patient records to the system.
- **Editing**: Modify existing patient records based on patient ID.
- **Searching**: Find patient records based on patient ID and depth in the tree.
- **Removal**: Delete patient records from the system.
- **Output**: Display patient records, including those admitted to the hospital.
- **Tree Splitting**: Split the BST into two separate trees.
- **Node Counting**: Count the number of nodes in a subtree.

## Usage

1. Compile the program.
2. Run the executable file.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform various operations on patient records.
4. View the results, including patient records and tree structures.

## Dependencies

- The program requires a C++ compiler that supports C++11 features.

## Files

- `main.cpp`: Contains the main program logic.
- `PatientRecord.h`: Header file for the `PatientRecord` class.
- `Tree.h`: Header file for the `HospitalData` class, which implements the BST.
